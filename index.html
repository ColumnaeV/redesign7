                <p class="split-text">Hello there! My name is Christian and I’m the developer of this site. I’ve recently left Millard North High School whilst graduating with my regular and IB diplomas in search of higher education. Currently, I’m attending university in the state of California as a second-year to major in Biomedical Engineering.</p>
                <p class="split-text">I am an experienced free-lance web developer and graphic designer previously from Nebraska. Always caring for others to succeed in life, I co-founded C&amp;C Studios in Southern California, with my cousin and one of my best mates, to help those who are in need of a platform for artistic exposure. Within the last couple of years, I have been developing an expertise in graphic design whilst advancing my artistic ability in frontend design. Atypical to my current technological repertoire, I plan on pursuing my humanitarian ideals by providing for those who are in need of immediate care through my future studies in the field of medicine.</p>

                    <p class="split-text">Pursuing computer science would have been more ideal in another life, but in this life I have been driven to the medical field for specific reasons. Having first hand experience of the wrongs of the world and witnessing some of the worst men can do to each other in a time of hate has pushed me into a a mindset of constantly looking for resolution and repair.</p>
                    <p class="split-text">My first step into pursuing the medical career life was learning CPR. From then on, after moving to California I began donating blood whenever I can. Given the limited education of a second-year uni student, I still hold onto any information regarding health and medicine and offer it whenever the time arises. Actions like these may seem small, but in the reality that I have experienced anything can happen at anytime without warning.</p>

                <p class="split-header">Developing C&amp;C Studios</p>
                <p class="split-text">When first creating C&amp;C Studios, it was only designed as a photography and design platform between my cousin Camille and I, hence 'C' and 'C'. Still building the main website in early September of 2018, we both independently came up with the idea of Bobaddict, or at least a version of it. From there I decided that we needed someone with more graphic and digital artwork experience so I could focus on the web development side of Bobaddict. Bringing aboard my fellow mate from high school, Austin, we launched C&amp;C Studios as an artistic and digital design platform on the 23 of September, 2018.</p>
                <p class="split-text">For me, C&amp;C Studios always had the goal of increasing artistic exposure from the community. Scrolling through various social media platforms, there are thousands of people who produce artwork but aren't getting the exposure a masterpiece would. I wanted a place in which many forms of art were consolidated into one location for many to see, and in the end, hopefully be inspired to create their own. Many of my own works are influenced by other works of art. For instance, my current Photoshop style is based upon the album artwork of Disclosure's single, "Omen", and my current websites draw influence from Google.<br><br><span class="in-text-link"><a href="https://cncstudios.org/" rel="noreferrer">Visit C&amp;C Studios &raquo;</a></span></p>
